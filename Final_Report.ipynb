    "    \n",
    "We retrieved the Olympic data from Kaggle.  The data was already in CSV format when downloaded, so there was not need to convert the data into any other format.  The OpenWeatherMap data had to be downloaded in JSON format via the OpenWeatherMap hitoric weather API.  Once the JSON was recieved, we had to convert the file into CSV for further processing.\n"

    "Cleaning: Utilized Pandas to clan both the Olympic data as well as the Weather data.  Changed any null or Nan value to \"0\".  The data in general did not need extensive cleaning due to the sources of data.  The weather data from OpenWeatherMap was imported using a JSON format which yielded clen complete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deduplication: Again we utilized Pandas to review and delete any dupicate data.  We did not find ny duplicates in data.\n",

    "Format revision: Changed the date format in the weather data from unix date formate to datetime.date format so that we can utilize the date as a join in the database.\n",

    "Key restructuring: Establishing key relationships across tables utilizing the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Table \"games\"  : field games_id\n",

    "    6.Table \"medals\"  :field medal_id \n",
    "    7.Table \"weather\" :field \"date\"\n",

    "Aggregation: Since we are using a MySQL relational database wil will be using multiple full joins to aggregate the data.\n",

    "Integration: All data was normalized and uploaded to the MSQL database.  A complete list of tables are noted below:\n",

    "    teams create table teams (teams_id mediumint not null auto_increment, teams_name varchar(100), primary key(teams_id));\n",

    "    medals create table medals (medals_id mediumint not null auto_increment, medal_name varchar(100), games_id int, sports_id int, events_id int, teams_id int, athletes_id int, primary key(medals_id));\n",

Once we loaded the data, we processed multiple data validation tests to ensure that all of the data was transferred as intended.

Through this process we were able to validate tha the data was loaded properly and is usable for our data analysis.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The expected outcomes for this project if we would go into the next step of analysing the data, would be to find a relation between weather and the results of the olympics, in this case the medal count per team (a team is a country). For example if the temperature was low different countries would benefit and score a high amount of medal than when the temperature was high.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to work with average temperature and average precepitation because we do not have the information about the exact time the games took place (although it would be possible to find this information, but this will be very time consuming)."
